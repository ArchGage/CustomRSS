This is a mostly vibe-coded custom RSS reader to function as a replacement for my youtube home page, showing videos from specific channels and patreon feeds.
You can find the rss link to a youtube channel by checking the source of the channel page and searching for a link that contains "channel_id=", this should be the rss link.
It's kinda mega janky, sorry.
